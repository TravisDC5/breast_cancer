We have continuous data so logistic regression is a good place to start. Make a quick model and we have an accuracy of ~98.2%! However, our True positive rate is only ~92%, not as great. Why is there such a huge difference? When we break down our data we see that only about 10 percent of the data are positive (pulsar) results. This is something we need to take into account either in processing the data further or selecting our model. Another model that we can consider is a Gaussian Discriminant analysis model. For this model to be useful we need to verify that the data is normally distributed. and in fact it is.
